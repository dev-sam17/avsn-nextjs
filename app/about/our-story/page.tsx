          Established in 2021, AV School Of Nursing was founded with a vision to
          bring quality nursing education to Jharkhand. What started as a humble
          initiative has now transformed into a reputed institution nurturing
          hundreds of students every year.

          With a blend of academic excellence, practical exposure, and a
          compassionate approach to patient care, we’ve created a unique
          learning ecosystem. Our alumni today serve across government
          hospitals, private healthcare institutions, NGOs, and global health
          missions.
        </p>

          We believe in evolving with time — integrating modern methods of
          teaching, upgrading our labs and library, and fostering an environment
          of mutual respect, discipline, and growth.
